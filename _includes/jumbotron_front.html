                                <p>ChRIS reduces the barrier to cloud and distributed computing for researchers and developers. While geared initially to medical image analytics, ChRIS is a general purpose distributed data and computation platform. Easily convert existing analytics or create new ones and immediately have the benefits of distributed containerized workflows.</p>
                                <p>ChRIS workflows can run anywhere -- on your laptop, in your lab, on an HPC, or in the cloud.</p>
                                <p>Through our strong partnership with Red Hat, Inc and the Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC), you can moreover deploy workflows to the MOC — while still maintaining ownership of your own data.</p>
<p> ChRIS is the platform that makes it possible and easy.</p>
