      Born of biomedical image science and tempered by scientific
      workflows, ChRIS is ideal for running <i>any</i> complex analyses
      on <i>any</i> data almost <i>anywhere</i>. You can run <b>your</b>
      pipelines of analysis where <b>you</b> want: your local
      workstation, a local compute cluster, a cloud as well as anywhere
      and everywhere in between.

      Developed with scientific researchers in mind, ChRIS greatly
      reduces the barrier-to-entry for cloud-based containerized
      compute. In most cases, a cookie-cutter generated half-page "box"
      of python code is all that is needed to integrate your existing
      research analytics within the ChRIS platform.

      You focus on your code/analytics. The ChRIS platform takes care of getting the right data to your code where ever it runs. And <i>where</i> is simply anywhere it makes most sense to run your analysis: in a secure hospital environments with direct access to patient data, on a high performance cluster, even out on some cloud with access to huge repositories of public accessible data.
