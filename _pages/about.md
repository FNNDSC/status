<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>ChRIS is a pervasively open source framework that utilizes cloud technologies to democratize medical analytics application development and enables healthcare organizations to keep owning their data while benefiting from public cloud processing capabilities. 
</p>
<p>ChRIS allows researchers the ability to simply deploy the same application they have already developed in a cloud infrastructure with access to more data, more compute, and more collaboration to drive medical innovation. ChRIS uses Docker/containers, Kubernetes/OpenShift, and a set of other technologies to standardize healthcare application development.</p>

<p>
An instance of ChRIS is already deployed over Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital (BCH) and Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC), and it is possible to develop medical analytics plugins to be embedded into the BCH-MOC deployment. This deployment was highlighted in two keynotes at the Red Hat summit in 2019 with over seven thousand people in attendance.</p>
