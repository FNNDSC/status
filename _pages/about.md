<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>ChRIS is a pervasively open source framework that utilizes cloud technologies to democratize medical analytics application development. It enables healthcare organizations to keep owning their data while benefiting from public cloud processing capabilities. 
</p>
<p>ChRIS allows researchers the ability to simply deploy their applications in a cloud infrastructure with access to <strong>more data</strong>, <strong>more compute</strong>, and <strong>more collaboration</strong> to drive medical innovation. ChRIS uses Docker/containers, Kubernetes/OpenShift, and other technologies to standardize healthcare application development.</p>

<p>
An instance of ChRIS is already deployed at <a href="https://www.fnndsc.org/">Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital</a> (BCH) using the <a href="https://massopen.cloud">Massachusetts Open Cloud</a> (MOC). It is possible to develop and embed medical analytics plugins into the BCH-MOC deployment. This deployment was <a href="https://www.dotmed.com/news/story/42972?p_begin=0">highlighted in two keynotes at the Red Hat Summit in 2019</a> with over seven thousand people in attendance.</p>
