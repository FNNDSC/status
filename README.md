## ChRIS Weekly Status Updates

Every Thursday, a group of folks working on [the ChRIS project](https://github.com/FNNDSC) meet to share their status for working on the project. There are often useful discussions about development and planning and demos during these meetings.

This is a simple site set up to log the meeting minutes of those meetings for posterity. It is driven via the [FNNDSC status](https://github.com/FNNDSC/status) repository.
